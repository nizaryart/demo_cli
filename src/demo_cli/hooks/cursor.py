"""Cursor integration - the `beforeShellExecution` gate.

Cursor runs a `beforeShellExecution` hook *before* a terminal command executes
and passes the command as JSON on stdin:

    {"command": "<full command>", "cwd": "<dir>",
     "hook_event_name": "beforeShellExecution",
     "workspace_roots": ["..."], "sandbox": false,
     "conversation_id": "...", "generation_id": "...", ...}

A hook steers Cursor by printing JSON on stdout:

    {"continue": true,
     "permission": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
     "user_message": "...",   # shown to the human
     "agent_message": "..."}  # sent back to the agent

Two properties of Cursor shape this adapter; both are encoded by
`install-hook --cursor` in the `hooks.json` it writes:

  * Cursor defaults to **fail-open**: a hook that crashes, times out, or emits
    invalid JSON lets the command through. The hook definition therefore carries
    ``failClosed: true`` so a genuine failure blocks instead. Deny-on-the-
    unrecoverable is the whole point - a guard that cannot run must not wave a
    destructive command through.
  * Only **deny** is reliably honored today - Cursor's own allow-list can
    override an ``allow``/``ask`` from the hook. That is fine: our core move is
    precisely to *deny* the unrecoverable, the one decision Cursor respects.

Mode mapping mirrors the Claude Code adapter:

    shadow   observe only - evaluate, snapshot, record a receipt, always return
             ``allow`` (interesting decisions/snapshots surface on stderr).
    enforce  ESCALATE => deny, CONTEXT_MISMATCH => ask, otherwise allow
             (recoverable mutations are snapshotted first, then allowed).

Failure posture (the deliberate difference from Claude Code): when we hold a
real command but cannot evaluate it, we fail **closed** (deny), matching the
``failClosed`` stance Cursor asks for. The one exception is a *missing* command
- Cursor has a known defect that delivers empty stdin on some remote Linux
workspaces; denying there would brick every command over a harness bug, so we
step aside instead. A true crash is still caught by ``failClosed: true``.
