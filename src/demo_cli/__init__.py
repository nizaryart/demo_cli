"""demo_cli - a pre-execution safety layer for AI coding agents.

Preview before execution, capture a recovery point first, make it undoable,
and write a hash-chained receipt of every decision. The library is built
around one invariant:

    a mutating action must be recoverable AND match its declared context,
    otherwise it is escalated - never silently allowed, never falsely
    reported as "recovered".

Public surface:
    Guard          orchestrates classify -> context -> snapshot -> decide -> receipt
    Decision       the disposition + reason returned for a command
    classify_pipeline / classify     pure command classification
    decide         the pure, fail-closed decision function
    load_config    read .demo_cli.toml (declared targets and environments)
