"""The decision function.

Pure and fail-closed. It is the single place that turns a description of a
command (classification + context + whether a recovery point was actually
captured) into a disposition. It never performs IO and never captures
anything itself, which is exactly why it cannot lie: `recovery_captured` is
supplied by the orchestrator only when a snapshot of the *real* target
succeeded. There is no default target to fall back to.

Invariant:
    a mutating action must be recoverable AND match its declared context,
    otherwise escalate.
