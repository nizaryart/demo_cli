"""Recovery: resolve the real target of a command and snapshot / restore it.

The single most important property of this module is what it does *not* do: it
never falls back to a default target. If a destructive command's target cannot
be resolved to the thing it will actually affect, `resolve_target` returns
None, the orchestrator captures nothing, and the decision is escalated. That is
how the "snapshot something unrelated and call it recovered" failure is removed
by construction.

    * This function is NOT the honesty boundary by itself. When only one operand
      exists among several, the result collapses to that single path even if it
      lies outside the project; it is the guard's `within` project-root check
      (guard.evaluate) that refuses to snapshot or claim reversibility for it.
      Do not reuse extract_path_operand at a new call site without that bound.
    * The directory return means undo is COARSE: restoring a multi-path rm
      restores the whole captured directory to its snapshot state (see
      restore_entry). That is what keeps recovery a provable superset, but it
      also rolls back unrelated edits made to other files in that directory
      after the snapshot. Immediately after the rm (the flagship flow) this is a
