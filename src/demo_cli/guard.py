"""The Guard: the out-of-band reference monitor that ties the pieces together.

Flow for one command:

    classify -> resolve target (no default) -> build context (declared-first)
    -> compare declared intent to context -> snapshot the real target
    -> preview affected rows -> verify structural approval -> decide
    -> append a hash-chained receipt

Two modes:
    shadow   observe only - evaluate, snapshot, and record, but never block.
             The recommended way to adopt: prove value with zero workflow risk.
    enforce  gate - a blocking disposition prevents the action from proceeding.
