# demo_cli

**Claude Code and Cursor *ask* you to confirm dangerous commands, or *block* them. Their checkpoints cover the agent's own file edits — not shell commands or databases, which is where the destructive ones live.**

demo_cli snapshots the real target **before** a destructive command runs, so a wrong call is reversible with one command. **Confirming ≠ recovering.**

Before `rm -rf`, `rmdir /s /q`, `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`, `git reset --hard`, or `DROP TABLE` executes, demo_cli captures what's about to be destroyed and writes a tamper-evident receipt of the decision. If the agent gets it wrong, `demo_cli undo` brings it back. When it *can't* prove recovery (`terraform destroy`, `git push --force`, remote/cloud resources, or a recursive-force delete with no recoverable target), it hard-blocks instead of faking safety.

The whole design in one line: **recovery is the default; blocking is the fallback for the truly unrecoverable, not the default for everything.**

![demo_cli snapshots before an agent's rm, lets it run, and undoes it in one command](https://cdn.wepwn.ma/images/demo/demo_recover.gif)

*A real session. The agent's delete is **not** blocked, it runs, the files really are gone, and one command brings them back. It echoes [claude-code#76626](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/76626), where an agent ran `rm -f Reports/report_*.txt Reports/report_*.png` intending only to count the files. A CLI delete never lands in the recycle bin, and if the files aren't in git the only paths left are luck and file-carving tools like Recuva, which recover some fraction, not reliably all. A recovery point taken **before** the command removes the guesswork: it restores exactly the captured state.*

### Start in shadow mode, it changes nothing

Default mode is observe-only: it logs what it *would* have caught and touches nothing. Run it a week on a low-stakes project, read the receipts, then decide whether to let it act.

```bash
# one line: installs, wires the hook, and verifies it actually fires.
# pinned to a release tag, not the moving beta branch. read it first: install.sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING/v1.0.6/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING/v1.0.6/install.ps1 | iex
```

It ends by running `demo_cli doctor`, which fails **loud** if the hook is
installed but not reachable on your PATH — the one case where Claude Code would
otherwise skip protection silently. (Yes, it's `curl | sh`, the exact
opaque-execution pattern demo_cli itself escalates. Read it first, it's ~90
lines: [install.sh](install.sh).) Prefer to do it by hand? See
[Install](#install) below.

### Why you can trust it

- **No telemetry, it phones nobody.** There is no network I/O anywhere in the
  codebase. Verify it yourself — this returns nothing:
  `grep -rn "urlopen\|requests\|httpx\|socket\|http.client" src/`
  (`urllib.parse` does appear twice, for string handling only: building the
  prefilled GitHub issue link, and reading the hostname out of a DB connection
  string to tell local from remote. Neither opens a connection.)
- **One small, readable, MIT-licensed codebase**, read exactly what it does before you run it.
- **Tamper-evident receipts**, every decision is hash-chained and independently verifiable (`demo_cli verify`).

When it captures a recovery point, the hook prints it where you can see it — the
snapshot id, the one-line undo, and (on a wrong call) a prefilled report link.
No telemetry: the only signal it ever sends is the one you choose to send by
clicking. If it saves you something, a ⭐ on the repo is how it survives.

### "Why not just use git / Claude Code checkpoints?"

git and Claude Code's rewind can't recover an `rm -rf` outside the repo, a dropped database, or an overwrite of an untracked file, they don't snapshot before shell commands run. That's the exact gap demo_cli fills.

> **Threat model:** cooperative agents making mistakes, not adversarial evasion. An agent actively trying to evade protection is out of scope, no hook solves that.

`1.0.6`. Four guard layers on Linux, three on Windows (no shell layer there yet).

Built around one invariant:

> A mutating action must be recoverable **and** match its declared context, otherwise it is escalated, never silently allowed, and never falsely reported as "recovered".

---

## Why this is not just another blocking hook

Most safety hooks for AI agents do one thing: pattern-match a dangerous command
and **block** it. That stops the obvious disasters, but it also stops the agent
mid-task, so you either loosen the rules until they stop catching things, or
you babysit the session.

demo_cli starts from the opposite default: **recovery, not blocking.**

- For anything it can prove it captured (a file, a directory, a local DB), it
  **snapshots first and lets the agent keep working.** If the agent gets it
  wrong, `demo_cli undo <id>` brings it back. The work finishes; the mistake is
  reversible.
- It only **blocks** when something genuinely *can't* be recovered: an external
  or irreversible effect (`terraform destroy`, `git push --force`, an object-store
  delete), or a recursive-force delete that leaves no recoverable target. A
  Windows `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` with a single, existing, in-project
  target is snapshotted and allowed, same as `rm -rf`; `rmdir /s` and `del /s`
  remain a hard-stop in every environment until they get the same honest
  target extraction. There, it escalates honestly instead of pretending it
  captured a recovery point.

Blocking is the fallback for the un-recoverable, not the default for everything.
That's the whole design.

### And when it cannot recover, it says so

![demo_cli refuses an rsync to a remote host and explicitly refuses to claim a recovery point](https://cdn.wepwn.ma/images/demo/demo_honest.gif)

*An `rsync --delete` to a production host over SSH. No snapshot on your machine
can reach the far end of that connection, so demo_cli does not take one and does
not pretend it did. The most important line a safety tool can print is the one
admitting what it did not do.*

## How it works with Claude Code

Claude Code supports [PreToolUse hooks](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks):
a shell command that runs **before each tool call**, receives the full tool input
as JSON on stdin, and returns a permission decision. demo_cli is that command.

```
Claude Code is about to run: Bash(rm -rf dist/)
                              ↓
              demo_cli hook  (fires automatically)
                              ↓
         classify → resolve target → snapshot → decide
                              ↓
        { "permissionDecision": "allow" }   ← allow, with a recovery point
        { "permissionDecision": "deny"  }   ← blocked, reason surfaced to agent
        { "permissionDecision": "ask"   }   ← paused, human decides
```

**One property worth knowing:** a PreToolUse hook returning `deny` stops the tool
**even when the session is running `--dangerously-skip-permissions` or
`bypassPermissions`**, that mode skips the interactive prompts, not the hooks.
So the recovery-and-escalation layer holds even in a fully autonomous run. (The
one way it does *not* fire: if the `demo_cli` binary isn't on PATH in the shell
where `claude` launched, Claude Code silently proceeds with no check, see
[Known issues](#known-issues-beta). Run `demo_cli doctor` to confirm.)

demo_cli gates **both** tool categories Claude Code uses to modify your project:
- `Bash` - shell commands (`rm`, `git reset --hard`, `terraform destroy`, …)
- `Edit` / `Write` / `MultiEdit` / `NotebookEdit` - direct file mutations

A file or directory is snapshotted **before** it is touched. If the agent
destroys something, `demo_cli undo <id>` brings it back.

---

## How it works with Cursor

Cursor supports [hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks): scripts it runs at named
points in the agent loop. demo_cli registers a `beforeShellExecution` hook that
receives the command as JSON on stdin (`command`, `cwd`, …) and returns a
permission decision.

```bash
demo_cli install-hook --cursor          # writes .cursor/hooks.json (project)
demo_cli install-hook --cursor --scope global   # or ~/.cursor/hooks.json
demo_cli install-hook --cursor --print  # inspect the snippet without writing
```

The installed hook looks like this:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "beforeShellExecution": [
      { "command": "demo_cli hook-cursor", "failClosed": true }
    ]
  }
}
```

Two Cursor-specific properties, both handled deliberately:

- **`failClosed: true` is mandatory.** By default Cursor *fails open*: a hook
  that crashes, times out, or emits invalid JSON lets the command through.
  `failClosed: true` inverts that, a guard that cannot run blocks instead. The
  adapter also fails closed *inside* the script: if it holds a real command it
  cannot evaluate, it returns `deny` (the opposite of the Claude Code adapter's
  fail-open on internal error). The one exception is Cursor's known empty-stdin
  defect on some remote workspaces, where there is no command to judge, so it
  steps aside rather than brick the session.
- **Only `deny` is reliably honored today.** Cursor's own allow-list can
  override an `allow`/`ask` from a hook. That is fine here: the whole move is to
  *deny the unrecoverable*, which is exactly the decision Cursor respects. So a
  recursive-force delete on Cursor is stopped by the same rule that stops it in
  Claude Code.

Scope for this beta: the Cursor adapter gates **shell commands** only
(`beforeShellExecution`). File-edit gating is Claude Code only for now.

## Install

Requires Python 3.9+.

> **Pin to a release, not to `beta`.** The commands below reference a fixed,
> tagged release so you get exactly the code you reviewed. `@beta` is a moving
> branch and can change under you; use it only if you specifically want the
> latest unreleased commit. Replace `v1.0.6` below with the
> [latest release](https://github.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING/releases) if a newer one exists.

**Manual, verify before you run (recommended).** Read the source and confirm the
artifact's checksum before anything executes. Nothing is piped into a shell:

```bash
# 1. read the release notes + published SHA-256 on the release page:
#    https://github.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING/releases/tag/v1.0.6
#
# 2. install that exact tag (pipx puts demo_cli on your global PATH so
#    Claude Code finds it from any project directory):
pipx install "git+https://github.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING.git@v1.0.6"
demo_cli --version        # should print 1.0.6

# 3. wire the hook into this project (shadow mode by default) and confirm it fires
demo_cli init && demo_cli install-hook && demo_cli doctor
```

**From a clone (read everything first, verify the tag):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING.git
cd DEMO_LOADING
git checkout v1.0.6
git verify-tag v1.0.6   # if the release is signed; otherwise skip
pipx install -e .
demo_cli --version
```

**One line (convenience only).** This is `curl | sh`, the exact opaque
fetch-and-run pattern demo_cli itself escalates. It's here because it's
convenient, not because it's the safe way. Read the script first, it's ~90
lines: [install.sh](install.sh) / [install.ps1](install.ps1).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING/v1.0.6/install.sh | sh
```
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nizaryart/DEMO_LOADING/v1.0.6/install.ps1 | iex
```

Every path ends by running `demo_cli doctor`, which fails **loud** if the hook
is installed but not reachable on your PATH — the one case where Claude Code
would otherwise skip protection silently.

> **Note:** if you install inside a virtualenv, that venv must be active in
> every shell where you launch `claude`. Otherwise the `demo_cli hook` command
> is not found and Claude Code proceeds without a safety check. `demo_cli doctor`
> catches this.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# inside your project
demo_cli init            # write .demo_cli.toml (shadow mode by default)
demo_cli install-hook    # register the PreToolUse hook in .claude/settings.json
demo_cli status          # confirm: hook installed, mode shadow, 0 receipts
```

Now launch Claude Code and ask it to do something destructive. demo_cli fires
automatically, no extra commands needed. Afterwards:

```bash
demo_cli log             # see every recovery point: id, when, kind, size, action
demo_cli diff <id>       # what exactly changed
demo_cli undo <id>       # restore to the state before that action
demo_cli verify          # confirm the receipt log was not tampered with
```

To evaluate a command manually (useful for testing or CI):

```bash
demo_cli check "DELETE FROM users WHERE plan = 'free'" --db app.db
demo_cli check "rm -rf dist/" --quiet
demo_cli check "terraform destroy" --actual-env production --json
```

---

## Modes

**shadow** (default), observe, snapshot, and record, but never block. The
recommended way to start: prove the value with zero workflow disruption. In
shadow mode the hook writes to stderr when it captures a snapshot or sees a
blocking decision, so the value is visible without affecting Claude Code's flow.

**enforce** - the hook actively gates tool calls:

| Disposition | Hook response | When |
|---|---|---|
| `ESCALATE` | `deny` | non-recoverable blast radius (infra destroy, force push, …) |
| `CONTEXT_MISMATCH` | `ask` | declared env does not match the resolved env |
| `REVERSIBLE` / `DRY_RUN` | `allow` | snapshotted first, recoverable |
| `ALLOW` | `allow` | non-mutating, no action needed |

Switch mode in `.demo_cli.toml` or per call:

```bash
demo_cli check "rm -rf dist" --mode enforce
```

Start in shadow. Move to enforce on a project once you trust what it's doing.

---

## Configuration

Run `demo_cli init` to scaffold `.demo_cli.toml` at the project root.

```toml
mode = "shadow"

[workspace]
dir = ".demo_cli"          # receipts + recovery points (gitignored)

[approval]
key_env = "DEMO_CLI_APPROVER_KEY"

[[target]]
match = "production"       # substring matched against the resolved target ref
env = "production"
recovery = "snapshot"      # snapshot | none
```

Environment is resolved in priority order: an explicit `--actual-env` flag,
then a `[[target]]` match in this file, then a heuristic over the command text.
A production database is reached via a connection string, not by a file called
`prod.db`, the declared target is always the source of truth.

---

## Command reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `check "<cmd>"` | evaluate a command; flags: `--db`, `--db-url`, `--target`, `--mode`, `--intent-env`, `--actual-env`, `--reason`, `--approval-token`, `--json`, `--quiet` |
| `log` | list captured recovery points (id, when, kind, size, action) |
| `undo [id]` | restore a recovery point by id, or the latest |
| `diff [id]` | show what changed since a recovery point |
| `verify` | walk the receipt hash-chain → INTACT or TAMPERED |
| `report` | summarise recorded decisions |
| `receipt [id]` | print a copy-pasteable, tamper-evident proof card for a receipt (latest, or by id); `--list` shows recent receipt ids |
| `status` | mode, hook state, receipts, chain integrity, recovery count |
| `doctor` | check python version, config, pg tools, hook registration, PATH |
| `prune` | delete old recovery artefacts (`--keep N`, `--older-than DAYS`); receipts are never pruned |
| `init` | scaffold `.demo_cli.toml` |
| `install-hook` | write PreToolUse entries into `.claude/settings.json` (add `--cursor` for `.cursor/hooks.json`) |
| `hook` | (internal) called by Claude Code; reads tool JSON on stdin, writes permission decision on stdout |
| `hook-cursor` | (internal) called by Cursor; reads `beforeShellExecution` JSON on stdin, writes permission decision on stdout |

Exit codes for `check`: `0` allow, `1` context mismatch, `2` escalate.

## What it covers, and what it does not

**Snapshot targets:** sqlite files, postgres (via `pg_dump`/`pg_restore`),
individual files, directories (capped at `DEMO_CLI_MAX_SNAPSHOT_MB`, default 256 MB).

**Shell expansion is resolved before the decision is made.** The command reaches
the hook *before* the shell has touched it, so `Reports/*.png` and
`file{1,2,3}.txt` arrive as literal strings, and a naive `os.path.exists()` on
them returns false. demo_cli expands globs and braces itself (`{a..z}`, `{a,b}{1,2}`,
nested, bounded), so it sees the operands the shell will actually pass to `rm`.
Skipping this is how a mass delete slips through with no snapshot taken.

**Affected files are printed before the action runs.** `check` renders an
**Affected files (preview)** section listing the concrete paths an `rm` / `mv`
will touch (also in `--json` as `affected_paths`). In the incident above, the
agent's stated goal was to *count* the files matching `Reports/report_*`, and the
expansion of that glob **is** that count, so the preview answers the question the
agent was asking and makes an accidental mass delete impossible to approve blind,
in the same operation.

**Multi-path deletes are captured when full capture is provable.** Several paths
that collapse into one capturable *subdirectory* snapshot **that directory**, a
superset of the blast radius, so recovery stays provable rather than partial.
Paths that do not collapse to one bounded directory still escalate.

**Capture surfaces that are always refused,** however small they measure:
`$HOME`, the filesystem root, a Windows drive root, and the **project root
itself**. A two-file `rm` at the top of a repo collapses to a common root of the
whole project, and silently deep-copying the entire tree on every such delete is
neither honest nor cheap, so it escalates instead.

**Escalated honestly, never falsely snapshotted:** terraform/kubectl/cloud
destroy commands, `git push --force`, remote filesystem changes, object-storage
deletions, external side effects (email, payments, webhooks), credential rotation,
and any database reached over a non-local connection string. demo_cli will not
claim a recovery it cannot provide.

**`Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` (PowerShell) is captured when its target is
provable.** Including the `ri` alias and abbreviated `-r`/`-fo` flags in any
order: `-Path`, `-LiteralPath`, or a single positional operand that exists
inside the project root is snapshotted first and allowed, same as `rm -rf`.
A missing, ambiguous, multi-target, wildcard, or out-of-root target still has
no honest recovery point to stand behind and is denied - in every
environment, including `development`/`staging`.

**`rmdir /s` and `del /s|/f` remain a hard-stop in every environment.** These
wipe a whole tree with no recycle bin and, unlike `Remove-Item`, the operand
extractor does not yet resolve their target, so there is no honest recovery
point to stand behind. A human structural-approval token is the one
legitimate override; an agent cannot forge it.

**Out of scope for this beta:**
- Adversarial agents deliberately evading classification
- Reversing already-sent external effects
- Reversing an action after it has already been undone once (single undo depth per recovery point)
- Adapters for agents other than Claude Code and Cursor (Aider, Cline, planned)

**Shell parsing is pattern-based, not a full AST (roadmap).** Commands are matched
with expansion (globs, braces) and structural rules, not a complete shell grammar.
Deeply nested substitution, unusual quoting, and exotic syntax are handled
*conservatively* — they fall to the honest escalate path rather than a confident
capture. A full command-level AST is on the roadmap; until it lands, ambiguous
parses are treated as unrecoverable, not waved through.

**Database coverage is SQLite and Postgres only.** MySQL, MongoDB, and other
engines are not yet snapshotted; a destructive command against them has no local
recovery point and escalates rather than being captured.

---

## Known issues (beta)

- **PATH:** `demo_cli` must be resolvable in the shell where `claude` runs.
  Install with `pipx`, or keep the virtualenv active. Run `demo_cli doctor`
  to check. If the binary is not found, Claude Code silently skips the hook.
- **Directory restore is coarse.** Undoing a directory snapshot reverts the
  **whole captured directory** to its snapshot state. That coarseness is exactly
  what keeps recovery a provable superset rather than a partial guess, but it
  also means unrelated edits made inside that directory *after* the snapshot are
  reverted too. Run `demo_cli diff <id>` before `undo <id>`.
- **A multi-path `rm` at the project top level escalates.** If the paths collapse
  to a common root that is the project root itself (`rm a.py b.py` at the top of
  your repo), demo_cli refuses to deep-copy the whole tree and escalates. Paths
  that collapse to a real subdirectory (`rm Reports/*.txt Reports/*.png`) are
  captured and stay reversible.
- **`mv` is conservative:** most two-argument `mv` commands are flagged. Safe
  renames inside the project workspace will be narrowed in a future release.
- **A pathological brace expansion falls back to the literal token,** which means
  the honest escalate path rather than an unbounded expansion. Bounded by
  `_BRACE_MAX`.

## Contributing

This is a public beta. The most useful reports are **real commands from real
agent sessions** that produced a wrong decision (false block or missed snapshot).
Open an issue with the command, your `.demo_cli.toml` (redact credentials), and
what you expected. Bug reports found through dogfooding, like the `rm app.db`
case that shaped 0.4.0b3, are exactly what the project needs right now.

To make that trivial, an in-context feedback prompt fires on a wrong-call-worthy
decision (a block, a context mismatch, or a snapshot): the tool prints a
`Wrong call? → report it` line with a **prefilled** GitHub issue (decision,
reason, matched rule, command already filled in). It is consent-based and
one-directional, a link handed to you, nothing phones home. It stays silent on
plain `ALLOW`s so it never becomes noise. `demo_cli receipt --share` turns any
receipt into a plain-text proof card you can paste into an issue or thread.
